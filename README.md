# aeonwallet

An original android wallet app built for Aeon. Connect to a node, load your wallet, and send coins. 

## What is Aeon?

Aeon is a cryptocurrency based on the Cryptonote Protocol. It is intended to be a minimal implementation with a goal of less encryption bloat and faster hashing algorithms ([KangarooTwelve](https://keccak.team/kangarootwelve.html)) while maintining the same private transactions and balances. Find more information https://github.com/aeonix/aeon.

## Download.

Find the apk files in https://github.com/ivoryguru/aeonwallet/tree/main/app/release. Most android phones will use the `app-arm64-v8a-release.apk`.

## Build instructions.

Some minor changes to aeon source code are necessary before compiling. Please see the changes https://github.com/ivoryguru/aeon/tree/aeonwallet.

Install these: `sudo apt-get install make python libtool g++ libncurses5 cmake build-essential git pkg-config libboost-all-dev libssl-dev libzmq3-dev libunbound-dev libsodium-dev libunwind-dev liblzma-dev libreadline-dev libldns-dev libexpat1-dev doxygen graphviz libpgm-dev libnorm-dev`

Build scripts require `ndk-r15c` in `/opt/android/`. See `env.sh`. https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/older_releases

Next, change directory to `external-libs` and run `make`. This will create the necessary lib files for the app.

After this is all completed, you will be able to open the app in Android Studio and build.

## How To Help.

Please report any issues using the app. 
Also, help translating and adding reliable nodes is appreciated.
